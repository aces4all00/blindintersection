I am Aces4All00, the Blind SysAdmin, and this is the future home for my personal site.

It's a work ing progress and pretty basic right now. So far it only contains the start of my blog. By the time I finish the next phase of its deployment I plan for it to have:

- An about section conatining more information about:
    - This site
    - Me
        - General information
        - Online safe version of Resume/CV
        - Portfolio of some exemplar work
        - List of projects (former and current)
    - Other defining information
- A blog for me to journal my ongoing adventures
- A micro section with a collection of short thoughts, ideas and statement

This site is in its early stages right now, however, and its final form amy be vastly different than what I currently plan.
